=INSTALLATION=

To get started with this extension, please run "python start.py".
This will add the necessary line to your Mercurial configuration to enable this extension.

If all goes well, you should be able to run "hg help cedit" and get started.

To quickly set up your initial name and email, run "hg setuser".

Note: If you are adding this extension by hand, be sure to give the containing folder 
as the path, not config.py. For example:

YES:
[extensions]
config = /foo/bar/hgext/cedit

NO:
[extensions]
config = /foo/bar/hgext/cedit/config.py

This is to ensure that the included version of iniparse is loaded at the
same time as this extension. 

=USAGE=

See "hg help cedit" and "hg help setuser" respectively for help on how to use cedit.
