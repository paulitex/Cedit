To get started with this extension, please run "python start.py".
This will add the necessary line to your Mercurial configuration to enable this extension.

If all goes well, you should be able to run "hg help cedit" and get started!

For a quick tool to set up your initial name and email, run "hg setuser".

Note: If you are adding this extension by hand, be sure to give the containing folder
as the path, not config.py. For example

YES:
[extensions]
config = /foo/bar/hgext/cedit

NO:
[extensions]
config = /foo/bar/hgext/cedit/config.py

This is to ensure that the included version of iniparse is loaded at the
same time as this extension.
